%APA7
%For the time being biblatex-apa is the only implementation of 7th-ed. APA citation and bibliography style. Note that you need at least version 9.0 (released 2019-11-23) of biblatex-apa (https://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex-apa).
%
%In particular a document using biblatex-apa must be compiled with Biber instead of BibTeX (some background is at bibtex vs. biber  - https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/25701/bibtex-vs-biber-and-biblatex-vs-natbib), so you may have to reconfigure your editor:

% ### HYPERLINKS PACKAGE
\usepackage[hidelinks]{hyperref}
% This package is used to emend cross-referencing commands in LaTeX to
% produce some sort of \special commands; there are backends for the
% special set defined for HyperTeX dvi processors, for embedded pdfmark
% commands for processing by Acrobat Distiller (dvips and dvipsone), for
% dviwindo, for pdfTeX, for dvipdfm, for TeX4ht, and for VTEX's pdf and
% HTML backends.

% commands.
